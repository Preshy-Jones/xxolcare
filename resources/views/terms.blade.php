                    <p class="text-sm text-center md:text-justify mt-6">We use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies

                        <b>Cookies</b> <br>
                        Cookies are small data files that help us keep track of your usage of the System. Many of the
                        cookies we use enable the System to function as you would expect it to. Cookies enable the
                        System to remember things like your login information so you do not have to re-enter it, items
                        in your shopping cart when you navigate away from the page, user preferences, and other
                        personalized settings. Cookies also enable us to track and analyse user behavior in order to
                        improve our System. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you can choose to
                        accept or decline certain types of cookies if you prefer. However, declining cookies may impact
                        the functionality of the System and in some cases you may not be able to access the functions
                        of the System. We use the following categories of cookies on the System: <br>
                        • <b>Session cookies</b> <br>
                        Session cookies are stored on the user’s hard drive temporarily and are deleted when the user
                        ends the browsing session. Session cookies are useful for things like keeping items in a shopping
                        cart while the user continues to browse. <br>
                        • <b>Persistent cookies</b>
                        Persistent cookies stay on the user’s hard drive until they expire, even after the browser is
                        closed. Persistent cookies are useful for remembering things like login information, so users do
                        not have to enter their password every time they visit the System. <br>
                        • <b>Third-party cookies</b>
                        Third party cookies are not installed directly by our System, but by third parties such as
                        advertisers. Third party cookies are used to track advertising preferences from site to site, and
                        to gather data about users’ browsing habits in order to improve the user experience. <br>
                        <b>Clear GIFs</b> <br>
                        Clear GIFs (also called pixel tags or web beacons) are small files embedded in websites that tell
                        us what content a user accesses and how users navigate the System. Clear GIFs enable us to
                        track and analyse user behavior on the System in order to make it more intuitive and user
                        friendly.

                        way. We will not make these types of decisions by solely automated processes. If you believe
                        that an automated decision-making process was applied to you, please contact us.
